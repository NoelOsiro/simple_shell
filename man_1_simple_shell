.SH NAME
.B skishell\fR \- a simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B skishell\fR [\fIfilename\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B skishell\fR serves as a basic UNIX command language interpreter, executing commands from a file or standard input.

.B Invocation
.in +2n
\fBskishell\fR can be invoked interactively or non-interactively.
If \fBskishell\fR is launched with standard input not linked to a terminal, it reads and executes received commands in order.

If \fBskishell\fR is launched with standard input connected to a terminal (determined by \fIisatty(3)\fR), an \fIinteractive\fR shell opens.
When operating interactively, \fBskishell\fR displays the prompt \fI$ \fR when it is prepared to read a command.

Alternatively, if command line arguments are provided upon launch, \fBskishell\fR treats the first argument as a file from which to read commands.
The specified file should contain one command per line.
.B skishell\fR runs each command in the file sequentially before exiting.
.in

.B Environment
.in +2n
Upon launch, \fBskishell\fR receives and copies the environment of the parent process in which it was executed.
This \fBenvironment\fR is an array of \fIname-value\fR strings describing variables in the format \fINAME=VALUE\fR.
.in

.B Command Execution
.in +2n
Upon receiving a command, \fBskishell\fR tokenizes it into words using \fB" "\fR as a delimiter.
The first word is considered the command, and all remaining words are treated as arguments to that command.
.B skishell\fR then proceeds with the following actions:

.RS
1. If the first character of the command is neither a slash (\fI\\\fR) nor dot (\fI.\fR), the shell searches for it in the list of shell builtins.
If a shell builtin with that name exists, the builtin is invoked.
.RE

.RS
2. If the first character of the command is neither a slash (\fI\\\fR), dot (\fI.\fR), nor a builtin, \fBskishell\fR searches each element of the
\fBPATH\fR environmental variable for a directory containing an executable file with that name.
.RE

.RS
3. If the first character of the command is a slash (\fI\\\fR) or dot (\fI.\fR) or either of the above searches was successful,
the shell executes the named program with any remaining arguments provided in a separate execution environment.
.RE

.B Exit Status
.in +2n
Upon completion, \fBskishell\fR returns the exit status of the last executed command, unless a syntax error occurs.
A zero exit status indicates success, and a non-zero exit status indicates failure.

If a command is not found, the return status is 127.
If a command is found but is not executable, the return status is 126.

All builtins return zero on success and one or two on incorrect usage (accompanied by a corresponding error message).
.in

.B Signals
.in +2n
When operating in interactive mode, \fBskishell\fR ignores the keyboard input \fBCtrl+c\fR.
Alternatively, an input of end-of-file (\fBCtrl+d\fR) will terminate the program.
.in

.B Variable Replacement
.in +2n
\fBskishell\fR interprets the \fI$\fR character for variable replacement:

.RS
.B $ENV_VARIABLE\fR	\fIENV_VARIABLE\fR is substituted with its value.
.RE

.RS
.B $?\fR			\fI?\fR is substituted with the return value of the last executed program.
.RE

.RS
.B $$\FR			The second \fI$\fR is substituted with the current process ID.
.RE

.B Comments
.in +2n
\fBskishell\fR ignores all words and characters that are preceded by a \fI#\fR character on a line.
.in

.B Operators
.in +2n

.RS
.B ;\fR - Command separator
.RS
Commands separated by a \fI;\fR are executed sequentially.
.RE

.B &&\fR - AND logical operator
.RS
.I command1\fR && \fIcommand2\fR: \fIcommand2\fR is executed if, and only if, \fIcommand1\fR returns an exit status of zero.
.RE

.B ||\fR - OR logical operator
.RS
.I command1\fR || \fIcommand2\fR: \fIcommand2\fR is executed if, and only if, \fIcommand1\fR returns a non-zero exit status.
.RE

The operators \fI&&\fR and \fI||\fR have equal precedence, followed by \fI;\fR.
.RE

.B skishell Builtin Commands
.in +2n

.RS
.B cd
.RS
Usage: .B cd [DIRECTORY]

Changes the current directory of the process to \fBDIRECTORY\fR.

If no argument is given, the command is interpreted as \fBcd $HOME\fR.

If the argument \fB-\fR is given, the command is interpreted as \fBcd $OLDPWD\fR.

The environment variables \fBPWD\fR and \fBOLDPWD\fR are updated after a change of directory.
.RE

.B alias
.RS
Usage: \fBalias [NAME[='VALUE'] ...]\fR
